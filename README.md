# Pig-Game
Popular dice game for 2 players, modified with extra rules.

The graphis and almost all html and css code are not mine. 
I did most of the Javascript coding for the new rules. 

How to play. 
Input a winning score and click on new game. Else the winning score is 100
Each players rolls the dice. By pressing Hold the round score is added to the total score. 
Rules. 
Rolling one in any dice loses the turn.
Rolling six twice in the same dice loses all score. 
Rolling the same number in both dice gives double the points even if they are both 1. 
Changes:
Made the roll dice button move to the side of each player.
